# Macroeconomic and Trade Dashboard

The purpose of this dashboard can be split into three-folds:

1.  Compile all necessary marcoeconomic and trade dataset from various sources, particularly from API's, and create a database to store the downloaded data for ease of use and so that I learn a little bit of SQL (In this case, I used SQLite because it's free and it works well with R ).
2.  Building dashboard to showcase quick key facts, statistics and visualisation of the both dataset. It also includes various modelling and forecasting as well as drilldown analysis for trade data.
3.  Lastly, because why not aye? doing cool stuff while you're looking for jobs is the best way to spend your time instead of wondering around and praying to probability god in hoping that i could land a job ASAP. Might as well just do this kind of stuff aye?

## Structure of the Project

There is a saying if you're building a house without a proper structure then it would definitely be a crappy house. To be fair, at this day and age, HAVING a house is an achievement already when EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE from the land down to the nuts and bolts. The moral of the story is just work harder and scale up the corporate ladder so that you have enough cash to not build/buy a crappy house. How does the aforementioned story is related with this project? Well, for one I associate myself with the story above but will try to collate and compress this behemoth and unstructured mess into much a readable format (I hope).

## Phase 1 : Pull dataset and push it to SQLite database

## Phase 2 : Designing and building THE dashboard 

## Phase 3: Host it online through shinyapps.io.
